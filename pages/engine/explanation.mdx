# Rules Engine

The Construct Rules Engine is an application allowing someone to create custom rulebooks for construct systems.  
To use the webapp, first create a construct bundle file along the lines of this:
```toml
moduleType = "bundle"
displayName = "Core Bundle"

[[dependencies]]
url = "https://github.com/construct-rpg/core-rules.git"
version = "main" # Use latest commit on main
 
[[dependencies]]
url = "https://github.com/construct-rpg/core-traits.git"
version = "v1.0" # Use commit tagged with v1.0

[[dependencies]]
url = "https://github.com/construct-rpg/non-existant-module-with-options.git"
version = "main"

[[dependencies.options]] # Options for non existant module with options
option1 = true
```

When you have created it, either upload it to a webserver or create a github gist(filename = config.toml) with it.  
Then you need to create a config string after following rules:
- If you used github-gists: gh-gist:GIST_ID_WHERE_CONFIG_WAS_SAVED
- If you used a webserver: url:URL_TO_DOWNLOAD_CONFIG

These config strings are then url encoded and appended to the following url:   
https://rules.construct-rpg.net/gen/

If you want help generating your config string use the web-app at https://rules.construct-rpg.net/gen-config-string/ .
